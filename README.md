# Verticurl-Asset-Tracking-System

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The project is to develop an asset tracking system that can handle everything from receiving assets to disposing of various consumables. The system represents a systematic process for maintaining, upgrading, and operating physical assets in a cost-effective manner with a focus on potential interactions within the universal system. Assets are grouped together and marked with a barcode, which allows the allocators to assign them to the employees when they are needed. When the assets or consumables have depreciated beyond the set threshold, or when the available stock falls below the set value, the system alerts the administrator, allowing them to place an order for more stock of that particular asset or consumable. The warranties for the various items vary, and users should be notified when the warranty period is about to expire or when a planned repair appointment is due. The administrator can also generate reports that compare the number of assets, consumables, and scrap to the overall number of assets. These reports also provide a variety of graphical representations to aid with reading and comprehension.
